You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of 
each variable for each activity and each subject.

Regarding the run_analysis.R script:

I guess it completes the first four steps, however the 5th step which is supposed to create a tidy set is incomplete.
Of course to run  the script, you have to set your own working directory which contains the data downloaded from

Some information about the data and the transformations used in .R file, can be found in CodeBook.md file.
